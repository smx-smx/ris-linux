To create the database files, collect all of the drivers you want to use
during installation in to a single directory.  For example, to collect all
of the drivers from a Windows 2000 installation tree, you would do something
like this:

    mkdir -p /tmp/drivers
    cabextract /path/to/win2k/i386/*.in_
    cabextract /path/to/win2k/i386/driver.cab

You may add whatever Windows drivers you need during installation to this
directory so that the BINL service can answer queries for device types not
directly supported by Windows.  This is useful for adding vendor-supplied
network device drivers.

Then run infparser to generate the nics.txt and devlist.cache databases:

    cd /etc/binl
    infparser /tmp/drivers
    rm -rf /tmp/drivers

The temporary driver directory really just needs to contain the *.INF
files for the various drivers you want to use during installation.  The
actual driver files will end up being server to the client by TFTP.  The
BINL service only answers device queries and responds with a filename if
there is a match.
